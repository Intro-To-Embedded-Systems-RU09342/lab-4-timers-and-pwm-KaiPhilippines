# Hardware PWM
In this lab, the program brightens an LED each time a button is pressed. The TI boards used in this lab are the MSP430FR6989 and the MSP430G2533. For both, the two interrupts PORT1 and TIMERXX is utilized. Only in the G2553 is that at the start the onboard LED is initialized at 50% duty cycle. But for both boards if the PWM is less than the chosen value 1000, the duty cycle is incremented by 100 or 10% from 0-1000 through the use of the two interrupts PORT1 and TIMERXX.
