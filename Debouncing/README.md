# Software Debouncing
This program is meant to solve the issue of button debouncing by utilizing two interrupts Port1 and TIMERXX. There are case statements for both interrupts depending on the state of the LED. In PORT1, for case 0, if LED is on the button interrupt is disabled. For case 1, if the LED is off then the button interrupt is enabled. In the TIMERXX interrupt, for case 0, if LED is on turning on, switch state of LED, the button interrupt is enabled, toggles the interrupt edge on button release, TIMERXX is stopped then clear, and finally to the different state. For case 1, button interrupt is enabled, the button IFG is cleared, button interrupt is set to low, and the TIMERXX are stop and cleard. The only difference for the two board, FR6989 and G2553, are the LED setups and button setup.
