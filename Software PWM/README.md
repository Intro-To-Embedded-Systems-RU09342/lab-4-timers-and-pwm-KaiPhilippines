# Software PWM
In this lab, we are increasing the brightness of the LED each time the button is pressed. This code implements a 1kHz PWM signal with a duty cycle between 0% and 100%. Initially a 50 % duty cycle LED is generated. With the utilization of the PORT1 interrupt, and TIMERXX interrupt, the press of a button allows for the PWM to increase between 0% and 100% duty cycle within respective button presses.
